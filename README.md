Voice conversion (VC) is the process of matching the target speaker's vocal texture to that of a source speaker without changing the source speaker's speech's actual content. The generative adversarial networks (GANs) emerged as a superior alternative to the traditional statistical models for VC with the continued advances of deep generative models.  To effectively extract the formant distribution of the mel-spectrogram, a GAN-based VC model is suggested in this study.The speech samples produced by the VC model is significantly similar to the matching genuine human speech. It also incorporates a self-attention (SA) mechanism-based generator network. Additionally, in order to achieve high speaker similarity, the modulation spectra distance (MSD) is also included in this study as a feature-specific loss. Testing of the proposed model uses the VCC 2018 and CMU Arctic datasets. The suggested feature specific loss based self-attentive GAN (FLSGAN-VC) model greatly outperformed the state-of-the-art (SOTA) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03713">MelGAN-VC</a> model, according to the objective and subjective evaluation.

This repository contains the imorovements incorporated into MaskCycleGAN-VC to come up with a enhanced Region Normalized Relativistic Generative Adversarial Network. Our work was evaluated on datasets VCC 2018 and CMU Arctic and fetched us superior results in comparison to MaskCycleGAN-VC.
